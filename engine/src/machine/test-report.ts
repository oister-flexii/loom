/**
 * The TestRun trust rule:
 * - nonzero exit                                    → trusted-fail (a real failure is ground truth)
 * - exit 0 or unknown + report, ≥1 test, 0 failures → trusted-pass
 * - exit 0 or unknown + report with 0 tests         → trusted-fail (nothing ran)
 * - exit 0 or unknown + report with failures        → trusted-fail
 * - exit 0 or unknown + no report                   → untrusted (fall back downstream)
 *
 * An unknown exit does NOT sink a run that produced a report. A structured
 * JUnit/vitest-JSON report is STRONGER evidence about what happened than a
 * shell exit code: it enumerates the tests, and `findReport`'s freshness,
 * staleness, and write-veto guards already refuse a staged or pre-existing
 * artifact. Requiring an exit code on top of that gated trust on harness
 * capability rather than on evidence quality — harnesses exist whose Bash
 * tool response carries no exit code at all, and on those every run was
 * untrusted and the whole trust doctrine was inert.
 *
 * That reasoning holds only because the report is assumed to describe a
 * FINISHED run, and `attributeExit` nulls the exit for four reasons besides
 * "the harness reported none". Three of them still leave the test provably
 * finished (a later segment owns the exit; an `||` guard that a fresh report
 * disproves; a nonzero exit, which loses to `trusted-fail` above anyway). The
 * fourth — a BACKGROUNDED segment — does not, so `extract-evidence` records no
 * report for it at all rather than letting a mid-write report reach this rule.
 * The completeness precondition is enforced where completeness is knowable.
 *
 * A nonzero exit still overrules a green report: a runner that exits nonzero
 * after writing a passing report failed at something the report does not
 * describe, and the failure is the ground truth.
